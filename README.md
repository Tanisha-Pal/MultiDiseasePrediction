# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-WebApp-System-with-Streamlit-and-Python
🏥 Health Assistant - A Machine Learning Web Application for Disease Prediction

This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning models. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for predicting the likelihood of three different diseases:

1️⃣Diabetes

2️⃣Heart Disease

3️⃣Parkinson's Disease

By entering relevant health parameters, users can receive instant predictions powered by trained ML models.

📌 Features

✅ Diabetes Prediction

✅ Heart Disease Prediction

✅ Parkinson’s Disease Prediction

✅ User-friendly Web Interface

✅ Machine Learning Models Integrated

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Streamlit (for Web UI)

Scikit-learn (for ML models)

Pickle (for saving and loading models)

Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)


📊 Machine Learning Models

The application uses pre-trained ML models that have been trained on respective datasets for each disease:

Diabetes Model: Trained on the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.

Heart Disease Model: Trained on the Heart Disease UCI Dataset.

Parkinson's Disease Model: Trained on the Parkinson's Disease Dataset.

The models are saved as .sav files and loaded in the Streamlit app for making real-time predictions.

🎯 How It Works
Select a Disease from the sidebar menu.

Enter the required health parameters in the input fields.

Click the Predict button to see the result.

Get an instant prediction whether the person is likely to have the disease or not.
